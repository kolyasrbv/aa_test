# aa_test

**Tasks** 

- Run an A/A test
- Calculate FPR at alpha level = 0.05 (set subsamples without replacement of 1000). You will see that FPR > alpha! We need the opposite - to be less.
- Find the causes of the breakdown of the split system, focusing on the results of the experiment (hint: find an anomaly in the application version)
- Write conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis of the results of the A / A test
